        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a pharmacist passionate about using technology to improve healthcare. While I’ve spent years helping people through medicine, I’ve seen how many critical health issues remain unsolved—not due to a lack of drugs, but a lack of accessible health information and digital tools.

        <h2>Why This Course Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Learning HTML5 is my first step into web development. It’s helping me build a foundation so I can create simple, user-friendly health solutions—for example, a mobile-friendly web app to guide patients through medication safety, dosage reminders, and understanding side effects in local languages.

        <h2>The Problem I Want to Solve</h2>
        <p>
          One overlooked problem in healthcare is the lack of accessible, readable medication instructions. Many patients—especially in rural areas—struggle with medical information they can’t understand. My goal is to create an easy-to-navigate web platform that simplifies drug guidance, using images, simple text, and audio prompts.
